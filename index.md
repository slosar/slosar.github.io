
I lead my futile existence as a scientist and a bureaucrat. As a scientist, I work on data and theory related to surveys of the large scale structure of the universe. I am currently the Science Lead for the LuSEE-Night experiment: a NASA-DOE collaboration to send a radio telescope pathfinder to the far side of the Moon. On the more mainstream side, I am also involved in the [LSST DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/). As a bureaucrat, I am the group leader of the Cosmology and Astrophysics Group at the [Brookhaven National Laboratory](http://www.cosmo.bnl.gov/), a [Department of Energy laboratory](http://www.energy.gov/). Before coming here, I was working at [Berkeley](http://bccp.lbl.gov/), [Oxford](http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/), [Ljubljana](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/) and [Cambridge](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/)
