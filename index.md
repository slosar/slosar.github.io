
I lead my futile existence as a scientist and a bureaucrat. As a scientist, I work on data and theory related to surveys of the large scale structure of the universe. I am currently the Science Lead for the [LuSEE-Night](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/982134) experiment, a NASA-DOE collaboration to send a radio telescope pathfinder to the far side of the Moon. The instrument is expected to land in January 26 on the Firefly's [Blue Ghost 2](https://fireflyspace.com/blue-ghost-mission-2/) mission. On the more mainstream side, I am also involved in the [LSST DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/). As a bureaucrat, I am the group leader of the Cosmology and Astrophysics Group at the [Brookhaven National Laboratory](http://www.cosmo.bnl.gov/), a [Department of Energy laboratory](http://www.energy.gov/). Before coming here, I was working at [Berkeley](http://bccp.lbl.gov/), [Oxford](http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/), [Ljubljana](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/) and [Cambridge](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/).

~~Pledge against forced-birthing: I do not _i)_ travel professionaly to; _ii)_ submit papers or referee for journals based in; _iii)_ write reference letters addressed to instituions in the following US states (marked as "Elliminated" by [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/abortion-access-tool/)): ID, WY, SD, MO, AR, LA, OK, TX, MS, AL, TN, KY, WV. Exception for diversity and equity work or for strong personal reasons of others.~~
The pledge became unsustainable since I'm often required to visit Firefly, which is based in the forced-birthing loving Texas. Life sucks.
